This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing financial records (`PyBank`) and poll data (`PyPoll`).

## PyBank

The `PyBank` script analyzes financial data to calculate:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

## PyPoll

The `PyPoll` script helps a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process by analyzing poll data to determine:

- The total number of votes cast.
- A complete list of candidates who received votes.
- The percentage of votes each candidate won.
- The total number of votes each candidate won.
- The winner of the election based on the popular vote.
